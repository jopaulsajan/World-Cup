# World-Cup
The World Cup knockout round starts with 16 teams, each playing matches where the losing teams are eliminated. Each team has a FIFA rating, representing their relative skill level. Using these ratings, we can estimate the probability of a team winning. This program simulates the tournament multiple times (e.g., 1000 simulations) to estimate each teamâ€™s chances of winning. By running these simulations efficiently with Python, we can analyze outcomes and understand how rating differences impact tournament results.
